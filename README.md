# Finding-the-Best-Markets-to-Advertise-In
Where is the best location to sell e-learning products?

With this project, we aim to find the best markets to advertise e-learning products on programming. The courses cover a wide variety of topics from game development to data science.

For our purposes, we will be using the freeCodeCamp 2017 New Coder survey. freeCodeCamp is a e-learning platform that iffers courses on web development, and the company runs a publication with over 400,000 subscribers that attracts new coders with varying interests.
